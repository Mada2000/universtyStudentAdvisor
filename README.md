Is the Graduation Project to my university (Sadat academy for managment sciences) using xampp control panel and 
the programming languages are html/css for the front end and php for the backend.
I also used Adam Shaw's Copyright (c) 2009 template project in my files to eliminate duplicates in html.

NOTE: The site is still unfinished. 

the project works as follow you first need to enter the login_affairs then enter the code and password of the user then you will be logged in
he works as the admin and can add the students and professors(doctors) accounts and can also add the courses and a prerequisite course that 
needed to be enrolled in first 

then you can logout and login in as a student and enter your code and password to enroll for courses, check you grades and get material of the course

The professor then can add the grades and add the material of the course for the students to see.
